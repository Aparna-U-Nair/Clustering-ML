## Clustering - ML

It is basically a type of unsupervised learning method. Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them. There are different clustering methods:

  - Density-Based Methods - DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
  - Hierarchical Based Methods - Agglomerative, Divisive 
  - Partitioning Methods - Kmeans
  - Grid-based Methods - STING (Statistical Information Grid)

Here I have used DBSCAN , Kmeans and Agglomerative clustering methods to cluster the same mall_customers data for better comparison.
